# ClipGPT

Your teacher will be clueless...

## (Anti-) Features

- **Windows only!**
- .NET 7 (C# 11) | self-contained, single-file EXE
- WinForms
- Hides as a little tray icon.
- Uses `User32.dll` functions to register a clipboard format listener.
- Sends any copied text to ChatGPT, places response back into the clipboard.

## Building

The application may be built as a self-contained executable, enabling it to run even on computers that do not have the
.NET 7 runtime installed.

- Install .NET 7 (Framework & Runtime)
- From the project root:

    ```bash
    dotnet publish -c Release \
                   -r win-x64 \
                   --self-contained true \
                   -p:PublishSingleFile=true \
                   -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true \
                   -p:PublishReadyToRun=true
    ```
  
    Alternatively for Powershell:
  ```shell
  dotnet publish -c Release `
                 -r win-x64 `
                 --self-contained true `
                 -p:PublishSingleFile=true `
                 -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true `
                 -p:PublishReadyToRun=true
  ```

The resulting binary and DLL:s are located in `ClipGpt7\bin\Release\net7.0-windows\win-x64\publish`.
